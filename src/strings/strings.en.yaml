    blueGreen: With Blue/Green Deployment, two identical environments called blue (staging) and green (production) run simultaneously with different versions or service/artifact. QA and UAT are typically done on the blue environment. When satisfied, traffic is flipped (via a load balancer) from the green environment (current version) to the blue environment (new version). You can then decommission the old environment once deployment is successful.
    rolling: In a Rolling Deployment Strategy, the deployed artifact will be spun up incrementally until the desired count is met. As new ones spin up, the older version gets terminated.
    canary: In a Canary Deployment, the new artifact is deployed in the target environment and is incrementally updated based on the testing and verification in each phase.
    default: With a blank canvas, you get to orchestrate your deployment with any combination of steps from the palette. It allows maximum flexibility - only recommended for advanced users.

    Determine the pull policy of the Docker image:

    The default behavior is downloading an image if it doesn’t exist in the local cache, unless the “latest” tag is used either explicitly or implicitly.

    “If not exists” - only pull the image if not found in the local cache.

    “always” - always pull the newest version of the image.

    Resources limits allow setting maximum values for the resources the container is allowed to use at runtime.

    Use “Limit Memory” to limit the memory that the container can use. Limits for memory are measured in bytes. You can express memory as a plain integer or as a fixed-point number using one of these suffixes: G, M. You can also use the power-of-two equivalents: Gi, Mi.

    Use “Limit CPU” to limit the number of cores that the container can use. Limits for CPU resources are measured in cpu units. Fractional requests are allowed. The expression 0.1 is equivalent to the expression 100m, which can be read as "one hundred millicpu"
