/**
 * Sidebar Identifier represents a unique id for a `SidebarEntry`. It is used for two purposes:
 *
 * - Make a `SidebarEntry` unique.
 * - Group Module routes into a `SidebarEntry`. A Module route must declare it has a
 * `SidebarIdentifier` to avoid mistake in which developers forget to add their route
 * into a SidebarEntry, resulting the SidebarEntry is not highlighted/selected then their
 * route is mounted.
 *
 * If a Module route does not belong to a SidebarEntry (like Login, Reset Password, etc...), they must declare their `SidebarIdentifier` is `SidebarIdentifier.NONE`.
